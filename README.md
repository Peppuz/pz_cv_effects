# Personal Open CV Effets Library

## Face Glitch
Starting from a glitch effect seen on youtube, but no code, i wanted something similar on the face every second or combine it and make it go on tempo.

In pseudo code this is what the algoritm would do:
``` pseudocode 
I start from opening the video file
init a new output to write after the elaboration
then 
for every frame in videofile:
  call the face_detection library fuction
  apply the glitch kernel on the face found
  append the new frame to the output
buffer the output and write in the path location
```
easy stuff specially when coding in python, litterally, amazing.
